#### The result of this project yields the reposne of the newsAPI request and provides to the client/user a list of sources and articles from different news sources/power houses.}, {04/May/2022
#### By **Charity Mutembei~ Developer**
## Description
The application puts to use the web framework of python- flask. The application is also to be deployed to Heroku following its installation and a cli created. 
This application is to display news articles from around the world to match the needs of all that interact with it. In addition to the sources from power houses such as BBC, the applications provides articles and their direct access links to ensure that the users access the wanted news or updates. 
It is to be noted that the display indicates the author of the articles of available, the date the article was published and the content of the article itself. For further interaction or exploration, the links provided allows the user to interact with the different sources and the articles wholly and unprohibited in terms of access. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
The application does require the installation of Heroku which requires the gunicorn, a heroku account, and a command line interface of the Heroku account/application. Such commands are required to install the required Heroku account will are; python3.8 -m pip install gunicorn. For further instruction on how to get a Heroku account, then the link,https://moringacore-python.herokuapp.com/heroku.com. will be useful , to have a heroku cli, then https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli. will be of use. For further directions, then this page, https://moringaschool.instructure.com/courses/630/pages/thursday-deploying-to-heroku?module_item_id=56891. will be of extreme use for the procedures and commands to be followed for the success of running this application. 
However, the codes are to be found or possibly cloned in my github repositories directed to this link - https://github.com/Charity-Mutembei/FLASK-II.   
This project was done in conjuction to another found in https://github.com/Charity-Mutembei/FLASK-III. The two can be considered one but in different repositories. Before the merge and completion of the application, the two mentioned classes,needed and received singular applications each for the easiness found in its running and debugging before an attempt to merge and have a single application. 
## Known Bugs
 Although the applications functionality is well attained and applicable, the application is yet to be launched or deployed to Heroku due to lacking buildpacks compatible to it. 
 The homepage is recurrent in every other page and duplicates in the homepage. The codes such as the block contents are yet to be well mastered and are yet to be implemented efficiently. 

 The application lacks tests as well. 
## Technologies Used
This projects makes use of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, python, and the flask frame work is put to use. Heroku and Github too are the deployment sites of choice for this application.
